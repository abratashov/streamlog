= Streamlog

Streamlog is a Rails Mountable Engine. It streams application logs to the browser.

##Installation

Simply add it to your `Gemfile`

 ```ruby
 gem 'streamlog'
 ```

And then mount this rails engine on `config/routes.rb`.

 ```ruby
 Rails.application.routes.draw do

   mount Streamlog::Engine => '/streamlog'
 end
 ```

This will make the log available at ``domain/streamlog``. Make sure to authenticate this route.
